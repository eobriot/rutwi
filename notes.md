Things to do
------------
* After a certain threshold, stop adding to the tbd collection?
* If user has followers/friends above a certain limit, don't include him (the star effect, ex elisa dushku with 1M + followers)
* Adding index on ID didn't really improves performances. What can I do? inserting ids in the TBD queue is long.
** Maybe by using bulk insert. Got a few hits on Google, should pass an array of docs to #insert.
